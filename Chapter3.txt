“All right, folks,” Mr. Summers said. “Let’s finish quickly.”

Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, 
they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys
 had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of pape
 r that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it
  up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. “Come on,” she said. “Hurry up.”

Mrs. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath. “I can’t run at all
. You’ll have to go ahead and I’ll catch up with you.”

The children had stones already, and someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles.

Tessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands 
out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. “It isn’t fair,” she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head.
